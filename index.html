    <center><h1>Alone</h1></center>
    <center><h4>Edgar Allan Poe</h4></center>
    <center><p>
From childhood's hour I have not been
As others were --</p> I have not seen
As others saw --<p> I could not bring
My passions from a common spring --</p>
From the same source I have not taken
My sorrow --<p> I could not awaken
My heart to joy at the same tone --</p>
And all I lov'd --<p> I lov'd alone --</p>
Then --<p> in my childhood --</p> in the dawn
Of a most stormy life --</p> was drawn
From ev'ry depth of good and ill
The mystery which binds me still --<p>
From the torrent, or the fountain --</p>
From the red cliff of the mountain --<p>
From the sun that 'round me roll'd
In its autumn tint of gold --</p>
From the lightning in the sky
As it pass'd me flying by --<p>
From the thunder, and the storm --</p>
And the cloud that took the form
<em>(When the rest of Heaven was blue)</em>
Of a demon in my view --<p>
